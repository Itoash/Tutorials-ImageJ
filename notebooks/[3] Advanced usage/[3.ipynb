If you need to track Context-wide variables or configuration, a <code>Service</code> should be used to encapsulate that state.\n",

In this way, only one [instance](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s1.html ) of each <code>Service</code> class can be associated with a given <code>Context</code> instance; an association that occurs automatically during <code>Context</code> creation. Furthermore, when a <code>Context</code> is asked for an implementation of a given <code>Service</code>, only the highest priority instance will be returned.\n",

For such reuse, <code>@Parameter</code> annotation can be used to declare inter-service requirements. During <code>Context</code> startup, these relationships will be resolved automatically."

Instead of being instantiated at `Context` startup as a `Service` would be, `Command`s are created and executed on demand.\n",

If any parameters are left unresolved and a UI is available, the framework will automatically build and display an appropriate dialog to get user input. In this way, input harvesting is decoupled from functional operation—allowing developers to focus on what's really important without repetition of code. This also means that `Command`s can typically run [headlessly](http://imagej.net/Headless) without any extra development effort.\n",
