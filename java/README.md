This directory contains example Maven projects with Java code for working with
[ImageJ2](https://imagej.net/software/imagej2) and [SciJava](https://imagej.net/libs/scijava).


JAVA PROJECTS
-------------

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/imagej/tutorials)

Use the "Open in Gitpod" button above to run the (non-GUI) Java projects on the
cloud using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io), with no local installation necessary.

Additionally, you can import these projects into your favorite IDE. The Java files in these tutorials have main methods that can be directly ran inside of your IDE. 

  * Eclipse: File > Import > Existing Maven Projects > tutorials > java
  * NetBeans: File > Open Project
  * IntelliJ IDEA: File > Open > tutorials > pom.xml > Open as Project


We are in the process of migrating projects into the `howtos` project. As such, that will be an excellent entry point to become familiar with ImageJ2 and SciJava.  

`HelloWorld.Java` and `OpenImage.java` inside of `howtos.commands.simple` are good starting points to see the annotation syntax for creating plugins. From there, you can go to the project that best fits your needs.  

If you would like to learn more about plugin development, see [Writing ImageJ2 plugins](https://imagej.net/develop/plugins).
